        <h3>Welcome to Cute Delights!</h3>
        <p>My name is Amano Ichigo and I am a student at St. Marie Academy in the Japan Branch. I was competing in the Cake Grand Prix, that my school was holding, for a chance to study at the main branch in Paris with my team! In my team, we have Kashino Makoto, Hanabusa Satsuki, and Sennosuke Andou. Also, our Sweet Spirits, Vanilla, Chocolat, Cafe, and Caramel. I decided to create a blog of all the creations we've made, so I could share it with everybody!</p>
